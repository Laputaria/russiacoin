MSYS shell:
un-tar sources with MSYS 'tar xfz' to avoid issue with symlinks (OpenSSL ticket 2377)
change 'MAKE' env. variable from 'C:\MinGW64\bin\mingw64-make.exe' to '/c/MinGW64/bin/mingw64-make.exe'

cd /c/openssl-1.0.2q-mgw
./config
make

MSYS shell:
cd /c/db-18.1.25-mgw/build_unix
sh ../dist/configure --enable-mingw --enable-cxx
make
